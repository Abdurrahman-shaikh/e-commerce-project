# E-Commerce Full Stack Project

This project is a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce application built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It encompasses a range of features, including user authentication with Spring Security and JWT, MySQL database integration, and more.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes a combination of modern and robust technologies:

**Frontend:**

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling

**Backend:**

- Java 17 (JDK 17): The latest version of the Java Development Kit
- Spring Boot 3.1.1: A Spring framework for rapid and easy Spring Boot application development
- MySQL: A widely used open-source relational database management system
- Spring Security: A framework for providing comprehensive security features in Spring Boot applications
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): An authentication standard for securely exchanging user information between applications

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories for clear separation of concerns:

- `frontend`: Houses the React frontend code and its dependencies
